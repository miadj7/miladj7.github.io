I am a second year Master student in the  [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/) at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Danica Sutherland](https://djsutherland.ml/).

As an Undergrad at the [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/), I worked on designing adaptive online optimization algorithms using bandit algorithms.

I am currently primarily interested in Statistical Learning Theory, Optimization, Differential Privacy, and Online Learning. My research is focused on improving the power of two sample testing methods using selective inference ideas and exploring the potential of kernel methods in differentially private Data generation.
